	    This is the Pluribus Userland Consolidation for
                   Pluribus OpenSolaris Environment


Overview

    The Pluribus Userland Git repository is available at the URL below:

	https://github.com/PluribusNetworks/pluribus_userland.git

    This gate contains build recipies, patches, IPS manifests, etc. necessary
    to download, prep, build, test, package and publish open source software.

    This gate is a partial fork of the OpenIndiana Userland repository
    found at the URL below:

        https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-userland/

Getting the Bits

    You can clone the git repo:

      $ git clone https://github.com/PluribusNetworks/pluribus_userland.git pn_userland

    This will create a replica of the various pieces that are checked into the
    source code management system.

Building the Bits.

    You can build individual components. At present building the entire gate
    with one make invovation is not yet possible but this will be rectified
    going forward.

  Building one component

    A script is provided to easily build a single component and setup the repo.

      setup the workspace for building components

        $ cd (your-workspace); ./build.sh (component name)


      So if you have cloned to pn_userland and trying to build curl, the
      invocation will be like this:

        $ cd pn_userland; ./build.sh curl

      Note that components/curl is not specified. Some components has further
      subdirectories with multiple variants/versions. One example is OpenSSL.
      You need to specify the component directory and subdirectory you need to
      build:

        $ cd pn_userland; ./build.sh openssl/openssl-1.0.2
